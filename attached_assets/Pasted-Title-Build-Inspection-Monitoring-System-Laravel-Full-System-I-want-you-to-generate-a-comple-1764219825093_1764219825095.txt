Title: Build “Inspection & Monitoring System” – Laravel Full System

I want you to generate a complete, production-ready Laravel project.
Follow ALL requirements below very strictly:

🚀 1) Project Scope

Build a full Inspection & Monitoring System for a field-inspection team.
The system must allow officers to record daily inspection reports for multiple offices.

🧩 2) Main Modules

Create these modules with full CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete):

A) Users & Authentication

Admin

Inspector (normal user)

Laravel Breeze or Laravel UI (with Blade)

Role & Permission system (admin can manage everything, inspector can add reports only)

User fields:

name

username

password

rank

office

B) Inspection Reports Module

Each report must contain:

record_number

outgoing_number

officer_name

rank

office_name

inspection_date

notes

created_by (user)

Requirements:

Validation for all fields

Date picker

Soft deletes

Pagination

Search by (record number, officer, office, date)

🎨 3) UI / Frontend Requirements

Use Blade + TailwindCSS with a clean, modern, professional UI:

✔ Dashboard page
✔ Sidebar navigation
✔ Responsive layout
✔ Arabic RTL support
✔ Beautiful input forms
✔ Success & error messages badges
✔ Professional tables with search & filter
✔ Modern color palette (blue, gray, white)

Design Goals:
– Clean
– Modern
– Government-style admin panel
– No ugly bootstrap forms
– Full RTL layout

🛠 4) Backend Requirements

Laravel 11

PHP 8.2+

Use MySQL

Create migrations for all tables

Use Eloquent relationships

Create ReportController with all REST actions

Create UserController with admin-only actions

Seed an Admin account:

username: admin

password: Admin123!

role: admin

🔗 5) API Endpoints (for future React app)

Generate these API endpoints:

Authentication

POST /api/login

POST /api/logout

Reports:

GET /api/reports

POST /api/reports

PUT /api/reports/{id}

DELETE /api/reports/{id}

All endpoints must return JSON.

💾 6) Project Structure

Ensure the project is:

✔ Clean
✔ No duplicate files
✔ No unused controllers or routes
✔ All logic separated (Controllers, Models, Requests, Views)
✔ Use FormRequest for validation
✔ Use Resource Controllers
✔ Use Policies for permissions

🗂 7) Deliverables

Generate:

Full Laravel project code

Seeders

Routes (web.php + api.php)

🚀 8) Deployment Compatibility

The project MUST run without errors on:

Linux server (Apache or Nginx)

XAMPP/WAMP on Windows

MySQL database

🎯 9) Final Output Format

Deliver the output as:

Full project code

Clear folder structure

Installation instructions:
