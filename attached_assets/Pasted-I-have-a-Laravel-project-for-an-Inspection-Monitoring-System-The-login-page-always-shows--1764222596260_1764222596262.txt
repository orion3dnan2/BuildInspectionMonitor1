I have a Laravel project for an Inspection & Monitoring System. 
The login page always shows “بيانات الدخول غير صحيحة” even when using the correct admin credentials.
I want you to fully diagnose AND fix this problem.

Here is the exact issue:

1) The login form is working visually, but authentication always fails.
2) The seeded admin user (admin / Admin123! or admin / 123456) does NOT log in.
3) No error messages appear except “credentials incorrect”.
4) The project uses Laravel authentication (session-based), and the issue is likely coming from:
   - Wrong authentication logic in the login controller
   - Password hashing problem (password might not be hashed in database)
   - The database seeder using plain password instead of bcrypt()
   - Wrong user column used for login (username vs email)
   - Guard or provider misconfiguration in config/auth.php
   - Validation logic rejecting the input before login attempt
   - The login attempt using the wrong field name (e.g. email instead of username)

I want you to:

### 1) Scan all these files:
- app/Http/Controllers/AuthController or LoginController
- routes/web.php
- routes/api.php
- config/auth.php
- User model
- database/seeders
- login Blade view
- Any middleware used for login
- Any custom guards (if exist)

### 2) Identify the exact cause of the failed login.

### 3) Fix the problem completely:

- Make sure the system logs in using:
    username → not email
    password → hashed password
- Ensure the database contains a properly hashed admin password
- Ensure Auth::attempt() uses:
    ['username' => $request->username, 'password' => $request->password]
- Fix any issue in guard configuration
- Fix validation if it blocks login
- Fix routes if middleware is incorrect

### 4) Regenerate a clean, correct login logic:
- Controller: correct validation + hashed password check
- Seeder: hash password with bcrypt()
- User model: ensure $fillable is correct
- auth.php: ensure provider uses username not email
- login.blade.php: correct input names

### 5) Deliver:
- Corrected controller code
- Correct seeder
- Correct User model
- Correct auth.php configuration
- Any route fixes
- Any middleware fixes

### 6) Finally:
Test the login in your environment and confirm it works.

Do NOT skip steps. 
Do NOT give theoretical answers. 
I need the actual fixed code for every file.
